<h1 id="propositional-logic">Propositional logic</h1>
<p>Propositional logic (also called sentential logic) is logic that
includes sentence letters (A,B,C) and logical connectives, but not
quantifiers. The semantics of propositional logic uses truth assignments
to the letters to determine whether a compound propositional sentence is
true.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Propositional logic is decidable, for example by the method of
truth tables:</p></li>
<li><p>Propositional logic is an axiomatization of Boolean
logic.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="predicate-logic">Predicate logic</h1>
<p>Predicate logic is usually used as a synonym for first-order logic,
but sometimes it is used to refer to other logics that have similar
syntax. Syntactically, first-order logic has the same connectives as
propositional logic, but it also has variables for individual objects,
quantifiers, symbols for functions, and symbols for relations. The
semantics include a domain of discourse for the variables and
quantifiers to range over, along with interpretations of the relation
and function symbols.</p>
<ul>
<li>Predicate logic (also called predicate calculus and first-order
logic) is an extension of propositional logic to formulas involving
terms and predicates. The full predicate logic is undecidable:</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="example">Example:</h1>
<p>A proposition is a statement that is having a truth value(either true
or false) associated with it. Where a predicate is a statement whose
truth value is dependent upon the variables.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> P(n):n is an odd integer. Where a n. domain
is a set of all integers. Here, P(n) is n. dependent upon Example 3+3=6
is a propositio n.</p>
